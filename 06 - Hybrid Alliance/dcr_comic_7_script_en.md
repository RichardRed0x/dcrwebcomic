# DCR Comic #6: The Hybrid Alliance

01

Forks can be a network's worst enemy. They destroy value, split the community and hinder development. Â¿Is there a way to prevent them?

02

Forks are always an option when talking about Free Open Source Software. Anyone can copy the project and start a new one. Even copy the whole blockchain, and go on to mine new blocks.

03A

But Decred is different. Economic incentives and clever cryptography make sure miners always follow Proof-of-Stake voting tickets.

03B

When conflict arises, the Decred community has tools to resolve it. On-chain consensus rule voting and off-chain Politeia proposals voting allows them to avoid splits and keep collaborating.

04

When a new block is found, it determines five random tickets whose signatures are required for it to be valid.

05

Miners are in for the rewards, and will follow the chain that gives them the most. On the minority chain, most blocks will pick up tickets that won't be active, because they are voting on the majority/other chain.

06

The minority chain ends up being not only slower, but paying less. If miners can't find blocks that point to active tickets, block production stalls.

07

Miners who remain in the chain with the mayority of stakeholders get to enjoy the reducen competition.

08

This configuration aligns miners and stakeholders in a way they both can collaborate to build a stronger, faster, better network.
