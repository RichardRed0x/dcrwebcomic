# DCR Comic #6: The Hybrid Alliance

01

**Contentious forks** can be a network's **worst enemy**. They **destroy value** and **split** the community. Â¿Is there a way to **prevent** them?

02

Working with **Free Open Source Software** means anyone can **copy** the project, even the whole blockchain, and create a different version.

03A

But **Decred is different**. Economic **incentives** and clever **cryptography** make sure miners follow the stakeholders.

03B

Meanwhile, Decred's on-chain **consensus** **voting** and **Politeia** allow the community to keep **collaborating** and avoid splits.

05

Each new block requires **validation** from PoS tickets. Otherwise it's **discarded**.

06A

If there's a Decred fork, Miners will follow the chain that gives them the most **rewards**. 

06B

On the one with less stakeholder support, the **minority** chain, most blocks will select **missing** **tickets** whose owners are active on the majority chain.

07

If miners can't find blocks that point to active tickets, **block** **production** **halts**.

08

Miners who remain in the majority chain will enjoy **reduced** **competition** and earn even more.

08

This configuration aligns **miners** and **stakeholders** in a way they both can **collaborate** to build a **stronger, faster, better** network.
